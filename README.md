#👋 Hey there!

I’m a B.Tech student driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and a passion for building systems that solve real-world problems.

I enjoy designing and developing practical applications and love working on ideas that have real-world impact. I am especially interested in **System Design** and building scalable applications.

I have experience in **Full Stack Web Development (MERN Stack)** and enjoy turning ideas into working products. I also actively practice **Data Structures and Algorithms in Java** to strengthen my problem-solving skills.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in **DevOps and scalable system architecture** while continuing to improve my development and problem-solving skills.

I am always open to learning, collaborations, and new opportunities.
